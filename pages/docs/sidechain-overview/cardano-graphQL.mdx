# Cardano GraphQL

Cardano GraphQL is cross-platform, typed, and queryable API for Cardano. It provides a query interface to all the blockchain data via GraphQL, which is a convenient choice for client applications based on web technologies (applications written in JavaScript, or any other browser-based languages, for example) that use HTTP/REST APIs to talk to other services.
